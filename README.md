Hey everyone, it's Hui. blender has been updated to 2.92, so today I'm bringing you an out-of-the-box, open-source Blender modifier and node preset management plugin I created - Auto factory - which is an iteration of the previous open-source plugin AutoMech. The Auto factory is currently GPL3.0 , but the preset text, generics and materials in the Preset folder will be a CC0 product. So you can do whatever you want, and you can also submit CC0 presets or code to improve the code on Github (the code for this plugin is currently pragmatic and spontaneous. So, go ahead and submit ðŸ˜Š). I will also be uploading a donated version or Pro version to a handy virtual shopping platform (don't worry, it won't be expensive at the moment, thanks for your support and understanding), which will provide project files, presets, etc. for current and future productions (of course, these won't be in Github ðŸ˜…), here's a brief demo of the functionality ðŸ˜‰

Uncheck New Data and check some new addon for best.
